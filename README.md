Compile with "javac randCFL.java"
Run with "java randCFL [input_file_here]" or "java randCFL -t [input_file_here]"


alternatively you can type "make" to use the makefile included. It works with the original test case given with the -t arguments included
the make run command triggers this command "java randCFL -t grammar 2"
